# Yuwei_Clock
Yuwei_Clock is a PCB-based clock that I designed and developed independently. The project was guided by Ethan and Matthew.

This project consists of two main parts: Hardware and Software.

## Hardware
The hardware part includes the design of the circuit board and the bill of materials (BOM).

## Software
The software part is composed of code written in Arduino, which drives the operation of the hardware.

## How to compile the code
You can use the Arduino compiler to compile this code.
